## üöÄ Quickstart Example

```typescript
import * as TPLink from 'tplink-bulbs';

const email = 'your-email@example.com';
const password = 'your-password';
const deviceId = 'your-device-id';

async function run() {
  const cloudApi = await TPLink.API.cloudLogin(email, password);
    
  const devices = await cloudApi.listDevicesByType('SMART.TAPOBULB');
  console.log(devices);
  const targetDevice = devices.find(device => device.deviceId === deviceId);

  if (!targetDevice) {
    console.error(`Device with ID "${deviceId}" not found.`);
    return;
  }

  const device = await TPLink.API.loginDevice(email, password, targetDevice);

  const info = await device.getDeviceInfo();
  console.log('Device Info:', info);

  await device.turnOn();
  await device.setColour('violet');
  await TPLink.API.delay(500);

  await device.setColour('red');
  await TPLink.API.delay(500);

  await device.setColour('orange');
  await TPLink.API.delay(500);

  //...
}

run().catch(console.error);
```

> **Note**: `loginDevice` resolves the device's IP address via your local network.
> Ensure the machine running this code is connected to the same network as the
> Tapo device. If you already know the IP address or ARP discovery fails, call
> `loginDeviceByIp(email, password, deviceIp)` instead.
